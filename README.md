# AddressBaseStructure
Simplified project for processing US address

  The goal of this project, initially, was to incorporate a standard relational database structure that handled common data 
validation issues, into a complete class structure for United States addresses. A complete class structure that will validate
and standardize a United States address to fit US postal standards with as much validation as possible. All into a class structure
that is simple to set up and use. 

  The first version was a full relational structure. It became evident that most developers found it to be an uncomfortable
paradigm shift for implementation. Additionally it allowed the user to enter city, state and zip data, that required validation.

  The second version, SimpleAddressStructure, is a much Simpler Address Structure, that consists of only 2 tables and meets the goal
of an easy to use, easy to implement address structure. This version eliminates the validation issues for City, State and Zip. 
However it introduced the issue where and address may not be in the database.
  
  Each version has a read me.
